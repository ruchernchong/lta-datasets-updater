 * The current state of every public connector, straight from LTA DataMall's
 * five-minute batch file.
 *
 * Nothing is stored: every live figure on the site derives from this one
 * cached download. The built-in `max` profile puts the timer far enough out
 * to be a backstop: the `ev-charging-live` workflow busts the tag after each
 * ingest, and that is what refreshes these figures in practice. Mind
 * that this query feeds the homepage too, and the shortest cache life on a
 * route sets how often Vercel regenerates the whole page — which is why an
 * earlier one-minute profile burned the Hobby ISR-write and CPU quotas.
 * Without an account key the snapshot is empty and the pages show their
 * empty state.
 *
 * It stays on plain in-memory `"use cache"`: serialised it is about 5 MB, over
 * the Vercel Runtime Cache 2 MB item limit, so it cannot be cached remotely.
 * The small request-time queries built on it use `"use cache: remote"`
 * instead, so a hit on those skips this download entirely.
